# Convergint learning pathways

This is a custom content pack served by GitHub Pages from a repository forked from [https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365](https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365). The content pack allows customizations to Categories, Technologies, and other lists that aren't configurable in the administration web part.

[Learning pathways](https://1651wilkening.sharepoint.com/sites/M365LP/) is a SharePoint application for organizing training assets (pages) into playlists, viewable within a web part on any SharePoint page in the tenant. It serves as a lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) alternative, delivering easily accessible training and communication content to colleagues.

Application installation and maintenance is handled by Convergint SharePoint administrators.
