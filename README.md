# Convergint learning pathways

This is a custom content pack served by GitHub Pages from a repository forked from [https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365](https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365). The content pack allows customizations to Categories, Technologies, and other lists that aren't configurable in the administration web part.

[Learning pathways](https://1651wilkening.sharepoint.com/sites/M365LP/) is a SharePoint application for organizing training assets (pages) into playlists, viewable within a web part on any SharePoint page in the tenant. 

This application serves as a lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) alternative, delivering easily accessible training and communication content to colleagues.

Application installation and maintenance is handled by Convergint SharePoint Administrators

# Configuration backup

M365LP stores tenant configuration in Lists on the site. [A Power Automate flow](https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/Default-2b4de1bd-251e-4878-bdb8-5180f7d15525/flows/shared/c6d9dcd9-ba64-4d28-8514-d55cb942abe0/details) copies select items from those lists and deposits them in lists on the [OCM SharePoint site](https://1651wilkening.sharepoint.com/sites/OCM) as a precaution.

CSV backups of the list are troublesome because the JSONData column contains JSON data ðŸ¤¯ that doesnâ€™t play nice with comma separation without tedious manipulation of the data that would complicate restoring from backup.

The Power Automate flow is owned by the OCM group and runs with @chambers connection to SharePoint.
